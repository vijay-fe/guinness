                                `The secret to how Guinness MicroDraught produces beautiful Guinness every time is the world-first patent-finding double coaxial piercing of a unique, specially designed can, which is filled with the very same Guinness that is kegged in St Jamesâ€™s Gate and poured in pubs around the world.`,
                                `Guinness MicroDraught uses an air pump - as opposed to the gas cylinder used in the traditional system - to push the liquid out of the can and through the standard Guinness Draught spout. The result is a beautiful two-part pour with the iconic surge and settle and cold, smooth taste that makes Guinness Draught a beer loved by consumers around the world.`,
                                `Two years in development, the pioneering Guinness MicroDraught dispense technology is the biggest technological leap for Guinness since the advent of the widget in 1988. The innovative, new Guinness MicroDraught system promises to enable licensed premises around the world to pour perfect Guinness Draught, no matter their size or setup.`,
